PROJECT 1 Group 1 
THe Assignment was to work into a group of four to create a project using the 
Phython thus far. To be used in the FinTech world. 

Aaron voiced he wanted a TextBot that would tell you if the specific market was going up or down during the day. 
Aaron created a Flow Chart

I was able to find code to represent a overlaid line graph showing the moving average for a particular index or specific crypto.
We decided to use S & P 500, NASDAQ, BTC and ETH. 
I ask thegroup for help with this because I was stuck on how to write this in Python. Todd and/or Aaron wrote the syntax creating this 
code. 
These graphs where recreated with .pngs in a Power Point preentation to be used May 12, 2022
